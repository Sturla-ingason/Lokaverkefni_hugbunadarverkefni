Assignment 4 Construction II
PO - Jón Aðalsteinn

The project remains mostly on track, with all of the use cases scheduled for this sprint implemented.
Image handling is however still pending but we plan to complete it before the final project deadline.
We encountered some database issues during development, mainly caused by mismatched data types between the code and the existing database schema.
Teamwork has been great throughout the sprint with meetings to discuss implementation status and when problems occurred we often relied on each other for help.
