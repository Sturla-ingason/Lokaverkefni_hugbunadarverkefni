Assignment 3 Construction I
PO - Ólafur Kristófer
The project is mostly on schedule with the plan that the team created, we have created methods for all the use case that were set to be completed in
this sprint but we are having some trouble with getting the correct Java Spring Boot setup so that information flows correctly troughout the software.
We are pushing back things related to images and follower data because we are unsure on how to properly implement those features. 
The teamwork has been good throughout the sprint and we have regulalry had meetings to discuss the current status of out use cases and if we need any 
assistance or diffrent ways to implement the feature.
